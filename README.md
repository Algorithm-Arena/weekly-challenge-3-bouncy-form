# Weekly Challenge #3 - Bouncy Form

**For this challenge, you need to implement a form with a bouncy ball that follows you around as you fill it and implements the "Squash & Stretch" technique from [Disney's 12 Principles of Animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation). The only restriction on the form is that there must be at least 5 fields to fill out.** Filling out forms is a big part of people's day but is also very boring, hopefully you can use this challenge as a way to make turn it into fun and playful activity!

### Winners:
* @mhelvens wins $100 for the cursor companion! It feels like something that can be dropped in any form and add some playful interaction. [Try it!](https://playcode.io/1748085) https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-3-bouncy-form/issues/4

* @luisperezphd wins $35 for the bouncy ball experience! By having a single field on the viewport at the time and a sick transition with the ball, it makes it feel like an adventure!

* @hurrymaplelad wins $15 for gunky form! It reminds me a lot of [World of Goo](https://2dboy.com/). It's a cool way to enhance the selected state of form fields. [Try it!](https://jsfiddle.net/19Lfuo0n/) https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-3-bouncy-form/issues/1

* Last but not least, @evgenyvinnik made this concept where you have to fill out the form to keep the ball in movement. If it stops, the form locks up! [Try it!](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/evgenyvinnik/bouncyBallForm) https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-3-bouncy-form/issues/2
