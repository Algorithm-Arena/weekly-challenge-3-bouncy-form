# Weekly Challenge #3 - Bouncy Form

**For this challenge, you need to implement a form with a bouncy ball that follows you around as you fill it and implements the "Squash & Stretch" technique from [Disney's 12 Principles of Animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation). The only restriction on the form is that there must be at least 5 fields to fill out.** Filling out forms is a big part of people's day but is also very boring, hopefully you can use this challenge as a way to make turn it into fun and playful activity!
