# Weekly Challenge #3 - Bouncy Form

This is the third edition of a weekly programming challenge that I'm going to host. The idea is to spur people's creativity. I used to run this kind of contest on [SC2Mapster.com](https://sc2mapster.com/) where every week I would come up with a map concept. It worked really well for mapping competition, I figured that this format would also work for programmers, yet I've not seen this kind of challenge anywhere.

**For this challenge, you need to design and implement a form with a bouncy ball that follows you around and implements the "Squash & Stretch" technique from [Disney's 12 Principles of Animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation). The only restriction on the form is that there must be at least 5 fields to fill out.** Filling out forms is a big part of people's day but is also very boring, hopefully you can use this challenge as a way to make turn it into fun and playful activity!
